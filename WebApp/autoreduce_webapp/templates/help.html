                In order to copy reduced data from CEPH to your local machine, you will need to download an SFTP client.
                We recommend <a href="https://winscp.net/eng/download.php">WinSCP</a> if you are using a windows operating system.
                The steps below are based on WinSCP as the <code>SFTP Client</code> and assume you have downloaded and installed it.
                Note that you can only access your data if you are on site, or using the VPN.

            <p>
                To add new instrument variables first you must be part of the instrument scientist
                team within ICAT. Once you are part of this team you should see an "Edit Reduction
                Variables" link on the right of the instrument name on the main run list page or
                "Add new run variables"
                Clicking either of these links will take you to a form in which you can set the
                values of variables exposed by that instrument's reduce script.

                Any value entered for a variable must match the type of the default value already in
                the reduction script. If a value doesn't match, you should see a warning message
                explaining the reason why you will be prevented from submitting new variables until
                resolved.

                To make sure new reductions coming straight from the instrument use new <code>reduce.py</code>
                scripts automatically, you can navigate to the instrument summary page for a
                given instrument. From here, select the "See instrument variables" link located on
                the right of the status table to view ongoing and upcoming instrument
                configurations.
                From here, you can select "edit variables" on the left side of the upcoming
                variables table. When presented with the variables, ensure that the
                "Track script changes" checkbox is checked. This is located on the right side of
                the page. You should then select the "Submit Changes" button at the bottom of the
                page to save this change.
            </p>
            <p>
                When re-running a job, if you want the re-run to use the current <code>reduce.py</code> script
                click the "Reset to values in current script" link under "Additional Actions" located
                on the right side of the page.
            </p>
            <p>
                To update instrument variables to the new ones entered into the <code>reduce_vars.py</code>
                script, navigate to the "Instrument Summary" page and select the
                "Configure New Jobs" button. This will take you to the instrument variables page.
                From here, click "Reset to values in current script", located on the right side of the page.
                This must be done any time <code>reduce_vars.py</code> is modified.

            <h4>How can I make a reduction script compatible with Autoreduction?</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
            <p>
                For a reduction script to be compatible with the Autoreduction web application,
                it must be named <code>reduce.py</code> Please make sure to expose what reduction variables
                can be modified.
                These variables must be made available in a file named
                <code>reduce_vars.py</code>. For an example of this please
                <a href="https://github.com/ISISScientificComputing/autoreduce/wiki/Getting-Started">See Here</a> for documentation.
                <a href="https://github.com/ISISScientificComputing/autoreduce/wiki/Example-reduction-script">See Here</a>
                for the full script.
                Autoreduction expects the reduction script to have a <code>main()</code> method
                that takes in two arguments, <strong>data</strong> and <strong>output</strong>.
                These are passed in a kwargs but it may be desirable for these to also be accepted from the command line.
                For an example of how to do this please
                <a href="https://github.com/ISISScientificComputing/autoreduce/wiki/Getting-Started#main">See Here</a>.
                The reduction script should perform all operations on the provided data file and
                save the output to the output directory provided to the script. The output will
                be copied to the cache upon completion. If additional save locations are
                required these can be returned as a list of system paths from the main method.
            </p>
            {% if support_email %}
                <p>If you feel your script will need to save to additional locations please
                    <a href="mailto:{{support_email}}">Contact Us</a> to ensure the locations
                    are accessible from the Autoreduction machine.</p>

                When you have made sure your reduction script is in the correct format and the
                variables are exposed, it must be placed within the Autoreduction directory
                within the user script directory of the appropriate instrument.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, the reduction script for MERLIN would be located at:
                <code>\\isis\inst$\NDXMERLIN\user\scripts\autoreduction\reduce.py</code> <br/>
                and the variables at:

                When a reduction job has completed, the reduced data is moved to the CEPH storage

                completed runs.
            </p>

                An example file path in CEPH would be:
